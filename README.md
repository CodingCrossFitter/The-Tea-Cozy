# The-Tea-Cozy
Codecademy Project


This was the off-platform Flexbox project from Codecademy.

Total coding time was about 2-3 hours. Tried and failed several different things on this second attempt but felt much more confident with it than the first attempt.

UPDATE: Opened on full screen Chrome tab and container formatting is wonky.
